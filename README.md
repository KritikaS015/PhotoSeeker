## Project Purpose

The purpose of the "PhotoSeeker" project is to provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to search for high-quality images using the Unsplash API. This application allows users to enter search terms and view a gallery of relevant images, complete with descriptions and direct links to the original sources on Unsplash. The project demonstrates my ability to work with third-party APIs, dynamically manipulate the DOM using JavaScript, and create a visually appealing user interface with HTML and CSS. It also showcases my skills in handling asynchronous API requests with the fetch method, enabling real-time updates and a seamless user experience. Additionally, I focused on optimizing the application for responsiveness, ensuring it works well across different devices and screen sizes.
